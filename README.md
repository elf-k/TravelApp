## Overview
TravelApp is a simple React Native + Expo application built as part of the Mobile Programming Lab.  
The goal of the project is to learn and implement **React Navigation**, including:

- Stack Navigation  
- Bottom Tab Navigation  
- Passing Data Between Screens  
- Custom Tab Icons  
- Header Styling  

By the end of the lab, the app provides a small travel guide structure where the user can navigate between destinations and settings.
